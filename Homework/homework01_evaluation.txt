HOMEWORK 01 EVALUATION
====================================================

Comments and feedback:

problem 1.3, your assertion that "It is necessary to expand beyond the 3×3
   area... most people assume the lines must stay within the square." This
   answer matches the classic out-of-the-box solution.  However, the second
   part of your answer, ["An expert system would not perform very well... it
   relies on stated rules/constraints, and the solution involves thinking
   beyond the given rules."] omits the fact that an expert system could be
   a reasonable paradigm, since facts/rules could be encoded and the system
   could infer that lines may extend beyond the dots.

problem 1.5, 100%

problem 1.7, 100%

problem 1.12, 100%

problem 2.1, you're missing some of the known classes/instances as listed on
   the problem page.

problem 2.5, you have some wrong notation, but using it as acceptable your
   diagram is correct.  "A/B" typically denotes set difference while XOR is
   denoted by "(A U B) - (A & B)" or "(A - B) U (B - A)"

problem 2.7, 100%

problem 2.13, 100%

Overall, very nice work on this assignment!  Keep it up...
